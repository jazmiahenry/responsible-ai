        "\n",
        "Transformers are a type of deep learning architecture in Natural Language Processing that processes the representations of words using a mechanism called self-attention. Self-attention layers give us the ability to mathematically represent the relationship between words in a sequence based on their probability of co-occurrence. Pre-trained transformers are deep learning models using self-attention that have been previously trained on large datasets and had its output saved for further researchers to use to train new tasks. \n",
        "\n",
        "Due to their scalability, pre-trained transformers have been the engines behind many of the most popular LLMs in the industry. In this notebook, we will explore creating word embeddings using a pre-trained Transformer called \"sentence-transformers\" found on the website, Huggingface. This model is open-sourced and can be used to create word embeddings based on each sentence's input within your dataset. \n",
